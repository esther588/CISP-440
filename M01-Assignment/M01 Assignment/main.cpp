 * Description : This is program
 * handles the following processes
 * n > 0 people are initially arranged
 * in a circle, facing inwards, and
 * numbered from 1 to n clockwise.
 * Starting with person number 1,
 * until we get to person number k (k > 0),
 * who is promptly killed. We then proceed
 * to count a further k people in a clockwise
 * direction, starting with the person immediately
 * to the left of the victim (that is, the victimâ€™s left).
 * That kth person is killed next, and so on,
 * until only one person remains.
